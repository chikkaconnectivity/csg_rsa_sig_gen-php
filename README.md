# PHP Chikka Service Gateway RSA Signature Generator

## Information

A simple library for the CSG (Chikka Service Gateway) clients for singing post
body requests to be sent to the CSG.

## Usage

Import or copy the contents of the ChikkaRSALib.php file in your code and
simply use it as shown below:

    ```php
    require_once("ChikkaRSALib.php");

    // generate a signature for string "my data" using file myprivkey.pem
    $signature = generate_signature("my data", file_get_contents("myprivkey.pem"));
    ```

For testing purposes, you can use the `verify_signature()` function to test whether
your generated signature is actually signed properly and can be verified by the
corresponding public key.

    ```php
    // verify given signature using the data "my data" and file mypubkey.pem
    $verified = verify_signature("my data", file_get_contents("mypubkey.pem"), $signature);
    if($verified == 1) {
        echo "Verification success"
    }
    else {
        echo "Verification failed"
    }
    ```
